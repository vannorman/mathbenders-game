@ [11:02 PM, 10/30/2023] Charlie Van Norman: Creative Math Games with AlphaPrime

Lord Numbersmith the 2nd (Mr. G, 5th -8th grade algebra/geometry teacher at Privaton Mathscooliosis): I've created the arena page for my students, but they all immediately die to the volcano as soon as the round starts. They want to know how to block the lava, something about parity. Anyway I don't pay you $2/mo for anything less than top tier support. I DEMAND that you give me the teacher level up package so I can always have a character more powerful than my students (it's too easy for them to beat me in Castle Eul!)
[11:05 PM, 10/30/2023] Charlie Van Norman: *Capture the Eul

We have to send them to Langlands

For the Eul

And they can never know why. let's tell them it's for freedom.

Different countries in the Langlands have different math lores, and they probably need to be saved by us, because we know the one true lore ("ðŸŽµ   2+2 is 4 --- and as for homework you've got more" our elders make us chant. Other places in Langlands...dark places... you must never go there, Sumba
[11:08 PM, 10/30/2023] Charlie Van Norman: And these other Langland countries are often enslaved. Be it infinity lording over integrals and derivatives, or Fib Boss Nachi ruling over anything that grows. Their gods make no sense. They must be saved for our god is the one. One thing we can all agree on though. The devil. Or should I say the godel.

Some say he started off as a triangle. But as Godel advanced in level and added more and more dimensions to his character (as one does when leveling up in a math game)
[11:10 PM, 10/30/2023] Charlie Van Norman: Now he's insane. Mathertons around the globe run at the sight of him. No matter what he touches it just .. poofs. Multiplication! You would think that's a solid ground truth, right? One time I saw Godel poof away an entire forest of number hoops. No one should ... could have that kind of power.
[11:19 PM, 10/30/2023] Charlie Van Norman: But anyway.. These other gods, infinities, fractals, relationship gods -- the gods of the people of the Langlands -- they are just nonsensical. Infinity? Like what even is that? You can't define it except by talking about what it doesn't do, which is end. We don't even have language to describe things that don't end. Ridiculous! Now take this multi blaster, load you up some 5s and 10s, get in the pod and we're about to save these people from their own ideas.

We crash land just outside of Goldbach's Castle. The moat is multi layered and uphill. You fight your way through bigger and bigger walls. 5, 10, soon 20 sized walls are blocking you in, as they try to corner you in the grid. (the game's current dimension is based on a large 3d cell map, each map cube being 100 meters cubed). But you find it difficult because you can't MAKE 10s and 20s.

5s were no problem everyone can make and have 5s.

But 10s would decay immediately into 5s if you were near the Eul. Which of course, the inhabitants of Fib Boss Nachi's realm are practically rolling in Eul. Ugh.. it decays another big number you were trying to make. And the more numbers you combine the faster it decays, so you cant just +10 ten times to get 100. It decays faster and faster. But why... and the people of Eul worship this stuff? And why were we supposed to bring it back to the ship, Research Purposes? Bert and Russel (two of your bosses) said they need to study the Eul. But suddenly they have started demanding vast quantities of the toxic stuff...
[11:23 PM, 10/30/2023] Charlie Van Norman: Meanwhile, at the Castle of Goldbach, which you must capture, you find walls of increasing alarming size. 100. 500! And because the Eul decays things so quickly you only get one combination. So you have to find two big stable numbers (that are not decaying) that combine to be 500 to break the wall quickly. It would be so easy with just 5 X 97 + 11 + 7. But blasting all those 97s caused too fast of a decay. There had to be TWO numbers, like 251 and 249. Which unfortunately 249 is not prime because the digits add to 15 which is divisible by 3.
