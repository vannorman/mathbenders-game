// Game Mechanics
    - Engines in general consume large numbers by -1 every frame, and eject "1" blocks in a direction causing a force in the opposite direction
        - implementation: Rocket (the one you're building)


@ A program's architecture should revolve around its ability to define and implement changes.
@ This program's architecture is optimized for quick iterational changes to the overall game state through multiple vectors, including physical world, portals, obstacles/trees, and entities

Long game is assessment as end games
no one has done open ended assessments, or asked why
