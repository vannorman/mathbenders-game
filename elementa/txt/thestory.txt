        // Story - moved from Trello Secret of Infinity board on Tues Aug 27 2024

		• Story: You work for NumberGloom, and you're asked to bring the "16", a special 2, to the portal area. You enter the 2^n world but you enter it with the relatively sized N which limits what you can do in that world. You're asked to harvest resources from these alien worlds and to restrict yourself to boring math. But you collect an infinity and you want to know what happens to that door when you use the infinity to open it.

		• You work for NumberGloom Corp, which harvests resources from primitive alien worlds. You're warned that they practice the forbidden art of infinity - But soon you find yourself falling in love with this alien world as you begin to uncover the true power of mathematics.

		• Story: Players access levels by inputting unique combinations of numbers. When they're given a large random number they're told, "this is your cache store. you can keep items here."

		• Story: Story: If you communicate with a geometric AI it can grow exponentially, The quest is, should it? https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/ Mana Games - The Secret of Infinity

		• You get in vehicles to harvest. It becomes an ever more complicated harvesting operation. You work on a farm.

		• You work on a farm, harvesting prime numbers. Along comes NumberGloom, and you decide to go the corporate route. Before you know it, you're flying to ancient alien worlds to harvest resources for NumberGloom on a massive scale. But you discover something lurking in the darkness on these alien planets. A mysterious people with mythical ways.. and a fierce guardianship over the Secret of Infinity.

		• Starship bridge scene - during missions you have giant star trek style "on screen" for each new world / mission / ally

		• Alt 1: Peaceful village. Castle sheep. NumberKnight roam in. Dominate village. Destroy, march. Evil number king. Control the land. Destroy them. Caught in prison. Escape the deep walled moat. Rally an army. Teach the masses powerful math. Run over the kingdom.

		• You're trapped in a dungeon with a number wall prison cell door. You break free to escape back to your home. you're a poor number farmer at the edge of town, and the kingdom is taking over your farm and imprisoning you for violations.

		• Eragon inspirer. ride on dragons back to nearby lands for special resource and help. Discover locals chanting noise that warbles and vibrated the fabric of spacetime. they chant the infinite series of Euler and others. Ramanujan is a very fast and smart enchanter who lived as a wizard in the mountains with many blockers like Magician Humfrey.

		• Eragon inspired. Ramanujan is training you. you could wield the power of a great wizard. dont mention math just moving mountains. But there's a disaster at the castle an explosion and you are washed into the river. eventually you find a town. You were warend by Ramanujan not to use magic but you do and the police come and take you to the king's cellar.

		• Dimensionality shift; you're not just a player, you're a "collection" of stuff. So your set size is one to start with. Eventually you grow your set (your tribe, team etc) and the properties of your set have direct effects on the objects in reality (there is no abstract reality; all experienced landscapes are generated by generator functions which the player will have access to below the terrain.)

		• As players move throughout the game they can imagine a 3d grid surrounding them and this grid populates with resources and tools. Sort of like an inventory; the game doesn't have an inventory per se, it just has "collections" and you can choose to dump it (but you can't select individual things, not yet at least)

		• Dimensionality. Game starts out relatively flat. Through different operations/ machines / resources you can "warp" the landscape making it increasingly tall and have valleys and peakes. Eventually you can access additional dimensions in this way (worldIsAngryAtYou shader).

		• meta: Federico. Collab good. Daily social bad. Deep work for me is about this much.
