class NumberInfo {
    // Todo: Move most numberInfo methods to Static methods here
    // Avoid having 1,000,000 script method instances on all the numbers
    // Strictly speaking a NumberBall or NumberSphere only needs ONE piece of information besides its physical collision; its Fraction
    // Text rendering can be handled by a shader
    // Collision, change number, etc can all be handled by static NumberInfo methods.
    // Super performance: To handle a literal 1,000,000 numbers we can use a particle system
