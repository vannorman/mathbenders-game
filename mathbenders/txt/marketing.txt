    The odd thing about direct calls with prospects was that we could never convince them to try out any of our products when talking to them face to face. Not Earthly CI, not Satellites, not even Earthly. At this point, we probably had over 100 calls with prospects. We were hearing over and over how they spent 2 years migrating to their current setup, how they put so much effort into it, and how throwing all that away would be so wasteful. And how annoying it is to switch CIs.

    And yet, when users were coming on their own to our website, through a mix of product-led / word of mouth and content marketing, the adoption of Earthly was happening every single day. At a very significant and increasing rate.
