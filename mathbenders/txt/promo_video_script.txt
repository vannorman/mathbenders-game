    # pan to the character's face. Narrator is speaking to the character. Character blinks and reacts.
    We provide full training, JUST like you learned in school. It's important you recognize the DANGERS of negative numbers. WE use them in various tools and gadgets which you will be trained on.

    Don't worry, we'll train you as best we can to prepare you.

    You're NOT to associate with them.
    # aliens worship infinity over a black hole fire.
    Infinities are dangerous.
