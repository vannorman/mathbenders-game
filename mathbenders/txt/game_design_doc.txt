@ SYNOPSIS
    You work for NumberGloom Corp, harvesting resources 
    from alien worlds. Aliens who practice 
    the forbidden art of infinity. 
    Soon you become enchanted
    by the strange alien worlds.
    You quit NumberGloom Corp,
    and begin to uncover the true power of mathematics.




@ CORE MECHANICS
    ^ Explore
        CLOUDS. How to get up there?!
        PORTALS. How to find / unlock?!

    ^ Harvest
        HARVEST. Venture into the forest, the dungeon, the moon, the castle, the river to harvest. You need to harvest and bring back to base.
    ^ Resource
        RESOURCE. Gather it, keep it, guard it.

    ^ Build / Break
        BUILD BREAK. You build, I break (and vice versa). Protect your RESOURCE.

    ^ Multiply resources by people count
        E.g. if there are TWO players near the tree, it produces N^2
        If there are FIVE players near the tree, it produces N^5

    ^ Machines
        number machines/cube creators. some movable.  some reusable. inputs for x and y sometimes z. 
        could be used in linear story as a bridge. 2x3 shores as a ghost outline. input 6 get all 1s. input 12 get 2s. 
        they break over time and the blacksmith can repair them if you can find him.
            // user story: i'm trying to make a really big prime x 6 to build a strong defensive wall
            // user story: i'm trying to make a big prime to trade for money to buy several x by y machines to build this castle i designed o 

@ Sub mechanics
    ^ Large grid of numbers, chop only one
        Your sword can chop only once, celluular autonama, chop the "right" seed to have some effect in the grid field

@ Number Theory, Statistics
    ^ Fibonacci etc https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-astonishing-behavior-of-recursive-sequences-20231116/
    ^ Large numbers to achieve an average (large != large)
        // https://thepalindrome.org/p/how-large-that-number-in-the-law
    ^ Fibonacci
        Fibonacci mechanic - storing energy or sorting
        // https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JxvKfSV9Ns&ab_channel=SithDev
    ^ Exp / Log - LOGs. Logs come from trees
        - Log scale /exponential scale intuition with fast forwarding in time on log scale growth patterns. teleport years, centuries into the future, 10**N where each layer is 10 times the last. 
    ^ Statistics / Stein's paradox
        - Stein's paradox (3 points normal distributions separate datasets) Stein's paradox (3 data points different distributions help estimate mew) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUqoHQDinCM
    ^ Computation 
        - we can make a computer inside super math world - what style computer elements should we make available for discovery that it is turing compatible / programmable? (see: Terraria Computer, Minecraft, Life, etc)

    ^ Addition -> Multiplication -> ????? -> Exponents
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP3pO7Ao88o&ab_channel=UnaryPlus
            

@ geometry
    Sqrt 1/2 - https://youtube.com/shorts/MRo1mUAS4lQ?feature=share 1/sqrt(2)

@ Random notes
     ^ "collect the primes" 
        once you have it at your base you always have more, but there are more primes to unlock that can be useful (for wall building).    
    ^ Number Boss
        NumberBoss the NumberMan lumbering with his body full of numbers. He's a "17" and you realize that it's difficult to zero it. You frequently go "over" the zero limit which does not cause this boss to evaporate to the negative domain. Instead, this boss has an especial hard feature that the numbers don't pop back after you modify them (so mistakes are cumulative).
    ^ Zones
        there are "zones", in them particles may appear according to some random statistical equation, for example in a "5" zone ther eis some % chance a "5" will create, and you can manipulate multiple zones together at scale if you can understand the statistical nature of what the zone is doing as a whole.
    ^ Machines
        a power machine. like a time machine you have to be very precise at the edge. like estimating a specific value. if you over or under estimate you'll end up too far away or too zoomed out to the place you were going (e.g. a specific number on The Number Line).


@ capture the flag // nature walls
   - DEFEND. at your base you have a large prime number gate(s). Thunderclouds roll in. Many negative numbers appear at your gates. They all begin rolling into your gate. They are dumb spikeys. The gate often simply defends as a large prime is not == 0 when mod some smaller prime. But then there are wizards. (10 x spikeys of "+2" and 1 x wizard of "+5")
   - Walls exist in nature and you can create and destroy them too. Walls are useful to stop or redirect number rivers, keep monsters out, and shelter you from the rain. Depending on numeric composition wall strength blah blah
